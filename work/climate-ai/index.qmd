## Background
By applying AI to climate risk modeling, we provide short and long-term insights into weather and climate impact, helping businesses identify the actions needed today to adapt to the climate change disruptions of tomorrow.

## What I Did
In my role as a Data Science Intern, I worked on creating more accurate short-term weather forecasts by using a multi-model approach. I tested different weighing schemes for the models based on different accuracy metrics across different regions around the world.
