Hi there, and welcome to my portfolio! I'm an environmental data scientist, currently working at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) as a projects data coordinator. Specifically, I work with NSF's Arctic Data Center and on the Permafrost Discovery Gateway project.

I'm broadly interested in the intersection of data science with environmental and climate science. Before coming to NCEAS, I researched the use of deep learning models in hydrological forecasting at UC Berkeley, worked on short-term weather forecasts at ClimateAi, and worked on a language modeling research project at NASA Ames. All these experiences contributed to my excitement for the potential impacts of data and computational methods in our understanding of our planet.

I received a B.A. Data Science with an emphasis in Earth Sciences at UC Berkeley in 2021, taking a mix of computer science, statistics, and earth science courses.
