## Welcome!

I'm Justin Kadi, and I'm an environmental data scientist currently working at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) as a projects data coordinator. Specifically, I work with NSF's [Arctic Data Center](https://arcticdata.io/) and on the [Permafrost Discovery Gateway](https://permafrost.arcticdata.io/) project.

I'm broadly interested in the intersection of data science with environmental and climate science. Before coming to NCEAS, I researched the use of deep learning models in hydrological forecasting at UC Berkeley, worked on short-term weather forecasts at ClimateAi, and worked on a language modeling research project at NASA Ames. All these experiences contributed to my excitement for the potential impacts of data and computational methods in our understanding of our planet.
