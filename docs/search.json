    "text": "Hi there, and welcome to my portfolio! I’m an environmental data scientist, currently working at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) as a projects data coordinator. Specifically, I work with NSF’s Arctic Data Center and on the Permafrost Discovery Gateway project.\nI’m broadly interested in the intersection of data science with environmental and climate science. Before coming to NCEAS, I researched the use of deep learning models in hydrological forecasting at UC Berkeley, worked on short-term weather forecasts at ClimateAi, and worked on a language modeling research project at NASA Ames. All these experiences contributed to my excitement for the potential impacts of data and computational methods in our understanding of our planet.\nI received a B.A. Data Science with an emphasis in Earth Sciences at UC Berkeley in 2021, taking a mix of computer science, statistics, and earth science courses."
