Specifically, I work with NSF’s Arctic Data Center and on the Permafrost Discovery Gateway project.\nI’m broadly interested in the intersection of data science with environmental and climate science. Before coming to NCEAS, I researched the use of deep learning models in hydrological forecasting at UC Berkeley, worked on short-term weather forecasts at ClimateAi, and worked on a language modeling research project at NASA Ames. All these experiences contributed to my excitement for the potential impacts of data and computational methods in our understanding of our planet."
